function result = sphereFitLSQ1_uncR(data,dummyVal1)
% This function takes 3 dimensional data of a sphere in a Cartesian 
% coordinate system and returns the paramters of a sphere (Center, radius
% and residuals
%
%The input data is in the form of Nx3 matrix
%The output is a structure with the sphere parameters.
%The function also takes in an optional parameter "dummyVal1" which does
%not do anything, and is retained for consistency purposes with other
%similar algorithms
